# Face Access System (LBPH)

This project is a simple **face recognition access system** using OpenCV’s LBPH Face Recognizer.  
It detects faces from a camera, recognizes known people, and logs access to an SQLite database.

## 🚀 Features
- Modular structure (Camera, Detection, Recognition, Database, Utils)
- LBPH for fast CPU-based face recognition
- SQLite logging of recognized people
- Dataset-based training (`DataSet/Name/1.png`, `2.png`, ...)
